# polyglot-sorting-algorithms

## Repository goal

This project was created to:

- Deeply understand sorting algorithms — from basic to advanced.
- Learn and compare syntax across a wide range of programming languages.
- Explore how different paradigms (imperative, functional, OOP) shape the same logic.


## Implemented Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm          | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Bubble Sort](Bubble_Sort)       | Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if in wrong order. Simple but slow.      |
| [Selection Sort](Selection_Sort) | Finds the minimum element and places it at the front.                       |
| [Insertion Sort](Insertion_Sort) | Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. Efficient for small data. |
| [Merge Sort](Merge_Sort)         | Divide-and-conquer algorithm with guaranteed O(n log n) performance.        |
| [Quick Sort](Quick_Sort)         | Efficient, in-place sort using partitioning. Fast on average.               |
| [Heap Sort](Heap_Sort)           | Uses a binary heap data structure. Guaranteed O(n log n).                   |
| [Radix Sort](Radix_Sort)         | Non-comparative sort for integers — sorts by digit positions.               |
| [Counting Sort](Counting_Sort)   | Efficient for small integer ranges. Not comparison-based.                   |
| [Shell Sort](Shell_Sort)         | Generalization of insertion sort with diminishing gaps.                     |


## Supported Programming Languages

Languages are grouped by their primary programming paradigm to help you explore different approaches to the same problem.

| Imperative / Procedural | Object-Oriented      | Functional           | Multi-Paradigm       |
|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Pascal                  | Java                 | Haskell              | Python               |
| Fortran                 | C#                   | R                    | C++                  |
| C                       | Swift                | Elixir               | Rust                 |
| COBOL                   | Kotlin               | Scala                | Go                   |

| Assembly (NASM)         |                      |                      | TypeScript           |
|                         |                      |                      | PHP                  |

|                         |                      |                      | Dart                 |
|                         |                      |                      | Zig                  |
|                         |                      |                      | Ruby                 |
|                         |                      |                      | Lua                  |



## **Notes**:
- For languages where the installation of the environment is difficult, online compilers were used.
- To improve the understanding of the code, a file has been added in the appropriate language directories README.md Since the syntax of the language required additional study, the README provides a step-by-step guide with detailed comments on each section of the code and an explanation of the language features used.
